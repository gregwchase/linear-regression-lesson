# Linear Regression Lesson

## Overview
This lesson gives students insight into applying linear regression
within the data science space.

Students will be working with the Iris dataset. Within machine learning,
this is a classic dataset, and used extensively in examples online.


## Getting Started

Make sure the `linear_regression` folder is on your Desktop!


Open your Terminal. Type `cd linear_regression`.

Once you're in the working directory, type `jupyter notebook`. Jupyter
is an interactive environment, which allows you to run your code in different cells in a single notebook.


Click on the `linear_regression_lesson.ipynb` file. All of the instructions are within the file.
