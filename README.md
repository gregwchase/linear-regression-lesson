# Intro to Data Science With Linear Regression
Linear regression is the fundamental building block of data science and analytics.
If you ever venture into data science, this will most likely be the first model you're taught.

This lesson is aimed at those with no experience in data science or programming.
It's also designed to teach you what a linear regression is, and how to write
a regression model within Scikit-Learn.

## Computer Prerequisites & Installation
